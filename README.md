# IMP spatiotemporal tutorial
Tutorial for computing spatiotemporal integrative models in IMP. For more information please check out the related publications:
* Latham et al. in preparation. (methods paper)
* Latham et al. in preparation. (tutorial paper)

### This tutorial explores scripts that:
* Generates snapshot models at various timepoints along a dynamic process
* Connects models at neighboring time points to produce a set of trajectory models of the process of interest
* Score and assess these trajectory models to evaluate their accuracy and precision

### Running the Tutorial
See [the IMP website](https://integrativemodeling.org/tutorials/XXX/) for the tutorial text.
